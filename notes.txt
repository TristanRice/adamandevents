Some more notes on the issue

' OR '' || '1' || '' OR '

^^ explained

string concatenation with one and 2 empty strings means that this is just ' OR '1' OR '. HOwever, the string concatenatino is needed because 


' OR%20 '1' AND (SELECT coalesce((select glob('3*', (select sqlite_master()))),'1') ) OR '
